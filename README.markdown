A simple application to generate two A5 pages from a landscape A4 page.

## Usage

It's very simple to use this application. Just run the following command:

    $ java -jar a5converter.jar myfile.pdf

Two files will be generated: `myfile-1.pdf` with all pages from the right side, and `myfile-2.pdf` with all pages from the left side.

I'm still working on a way to generate a single file, but for now, this is the only setup I have.
